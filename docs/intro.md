# Tutorial Intro

The React dApp Template serves as a fundamental starting point for dapp (decentralized application) development. Unlike frameworks, it provides full transparency, allowing you to examine, customize, and modify every aspect of your project. Nevertheless, we recommend following the pre-configured topics listed below:

- Organized feature-based directory structure
- Testing infrastructure
- State management utilizing Redux Toolkit and Redux Saga
- Internationalization facilitated by I18Next
- Styling with Chakra-UI theming
- Navigation and page management with React Router
- Authentication through the Metamask wallet
- Infrastructure for smart contract interaction

# Feature: i18n

**i18n** stands for internationalization and is a crucial feature for making your dapp accessible to a global audience. It allows you to provide translations and adapt your application to different languages and regions. With i18n support pre-configured in this template, you can easily localize your dapp's user interface and content.

The internationalization feature is powered by **i18next**, a popular internationalization library. It simplifies the process of adding and managing translations, making it easier for you to create a multilingual dapp.

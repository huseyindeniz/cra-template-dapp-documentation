# Deployment

Deploying your React dApp built with React dApp Template is a straightforward process. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to deploy your dApp to various hosting environments, including conventional web hosting and decentralized hosting solutions.

## Building Your React dApp

Before deploying your dApp, you'll need to build it using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles your React application into optimized production-ready code and assets. After running this command, you'll find the build output under the build directory.

### Conventional Web Hosting

You can deploy your React dApp to any conventional web hosting server that serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The generated build directory contains all the necessary files to run your dApp as a static web application.

### Decentralized Hosting Solutions

For a more decentralized and censorship-resistant hosting approach, consider utilizing decentralized hosting solutions. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to distribute your dApp's content across a network of nodes.

Here are some recommended decentralized hosting solutions:

- [Fleek](https://fleek.co/)
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
- [Arweave](https://arweave.org/)

These decentralized hosting solutions offer a robust and reliable way to deploy your dApp while contributing to the decentralization of the web.

Deploying your React dApp is the final step in making it accessible to users worldwide. Whether you choose conventional web hosting or a decentralized hosting solution, ensure that your dApp is available to your target audience.

Boilerplate your dApp frontend in a few simple steps.

```bash
npx create-react-app mydapp --template @huseyindeniz/dapp
cd mydapp
npm start
```

Are you tired of searching for and configuring numerous React packages? Do you get tired of writing the same boilerplate for each new dApp?

One of the challenges of building applications with pure React is the need to identify and configure a large number of packages to get the desired functionality. This can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for developers who are new to React or who are building their first dApp application.

The dApp CRA Template helps developers avoid this challenge by including a wide range of preconfigured packages that are ready to use out of the box. This includes packages for core functionality such as routing and state management, as well as packages for specialized features like internationalization. All of these packages are carefully selected and integrated to work seamlessly together, making it easy for developers to build powerful and feature-rich applications without the need to spend time researching and configuring individual packages.
